Description
A timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. Time is subtracted from the timer when questions are answered incorrectly. The quiz ends when the user runs out of time, or when they answer the total number of questions. Questions are given in random order (they will likely be in a different order each time you refresh the browser), and the questions may appear more than once. If you would like to ensure that all questions get asked, and in order, enable the commented out code on lines 82 and 86 of the JavaScript and disable line 83 by commenting that line.
